    <h3>God of war</h3>
    <p>
      God of War is a hack and slash video game franchise created by SCE Santa
      Monica Studio and distributed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is based
      on the adventures of a Spartan demigod, Kratos, who faces various
      characters from Greek and Norse mythology, both heroes (Heracles, Theseus,
      Perseus, etc.); mythological species (gorgons, harpies, or minotaurs);
      Greek gods (Ares, Poseidon, Zeus, among others), titans (such as Cronos)
      and primordial gods (such as Gaia). Although the Spartan warrior is
      accustomed to antagonize most of the gods, he receives help from many of
      them at some point in each game, especially from Athena.
